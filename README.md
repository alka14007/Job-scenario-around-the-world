Introduction: The purpose of this research is to learn more about the Job scenario around the world, especially the trend between the Developed countries and Developing Countries.

About the Dataset: The dataset contains the job scenarios and different variables affecting these scenarios across developed and developing countries. The timeline being compared in this study is a decade long between the Year 2007 to Year 2016 (10 years). The data has been collected from The World Bank Databases on the topic of Jobs.

Which countries are being examined in this dataset? Here, the intent is to compare the job scenarios between Developed countries vs Developing countries using economic indicators such as unemployment rates, labor force participation, GDP growth, etc. The data represents the developed countries like Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, The United Kingdom, and The United States as well as developing countries like India, Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Ghana.

The above Economic Indicators show that from year 2007 to year 2016, the number of female workforce has had a mix of highs and lows in developing countries, whereas developed countries have always seen a steadier higher number of female workers, consequently resulting in high wages over time and higher GDP Growth.

The significant population of women entering the workforce in recent years shows how a country has seen accelerated development as a result of increasing labor force participation.

Filters:
For the subsequent three visualizations, a filter option is available which allows the user to filter data from the following listed columns:

(a) Access to electricity (% of population): This filter shows how developed countries had access to electricity while developing countries still struggle with this basic necessity. A nation's employment is greatly influenced by its ability to provide access to electricity, which in turn promotes economic activity, industrial growth, and entrepreneurship, and improves quality of life. Thus, contributing to the overall economic development of the nation and driving more employment opportunities across a variety of sectors.

(b) Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP): significantly affects a nation's employment situation, impacting both employment and economic growth in several ways. The establishment or growth of foreign-owned enterprises in the nation is frequently facilitated by FDI. These companies generate new employment opportunities in sales, production, management, and support services. Thus, employment levels in the host nation may rise as a direct result of this.

(c) Total Unemployment (% of population): A nation's overall rate of unemployment is a critical parameter that greatly represents the employment situation by depicting the population, who are able and willing to work but are unable to find a paying job. A high rate of unemployment may indicate an overall struggling economy. It also suggests that there is a large under-utilization of the labor force, which may contribute to a decline in GDP growth and economic output which further results in lower wages, fewer benefits, and less job security for workers in the long run.

Second Visualization (Bar Chart):
The Bar chart demonstrates the comparison amongst the countries based on the aforementioned filters when selected.

Third Visualization (Area Plot):
The Area plot demonstrates variation amongst the countries in addition to a tooltip interaction, that shows a pop-up detail such as Country, Time Code, and the selected filter. A facet was introduced along with the Area plot to show variation by each country in a separate faceted data plot.

Fifth Visualization (Grouped Bar Chart):
Grouped bar charts can be an exceptional visualization tool when comparing data sets including countries, states, or regions. Hence, a simple grouped visualization was created to capture and illustrate how the countries has trended over a decade across radio categories such as - "GDP growth (annual %)", "Employment in agriculture (% of total employment)", "Employment in industry (% of total employment)" and "Employment in services (% of total employment)".

A tool tip interaction was also incorporated to observe data variation by year within a specific country.

How has Job scenarios changed in different areas of work? Through this graph it is shown that the population in developing countries have engaged in agricultural activities significantly more in contrast to the developed countries where the population opted for participation in services and industrial sectors instead.

Furthermore, annual GDP growth indicates that the developing countries has come a long way in exporting products and gaining profits over the course of a decade (2007-2016).

# Conclusion:
To promote higher-quality jobs in developing countries, several key factors and strategies are essential viz.: economic stability of a country, investment in education and skills are necessary. The population of a country should also have easy access to finance for creating high value businesses and expand job opportunities.

Access to innovation and upcoming technologies are equally important if not more, to compete in this fast-paced world. Last but not the least, access to proper healthcare, that can improve overall well-being of an individual and reduces the risks associated with getting ill and impact to a job or loosing a job altogether.
